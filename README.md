##Overview

The ESP32 Car Project leverages the ESP32’s Wi-Fi capabilities to allow remote control over a simple robotic car. It uses a motor driver to control the motors based on commands sent via Wi-Fi. The setup can be modified for Bluetooth control or even autonomous driving with additional sensors.

##Components

	•	✅ ESP32 Cam module
	•	✅ Pan Tilt Servo assembly
	•	✅ Servo motor
	•	✅ 4WD car kit
	•	✅ L298N motor driver module
	•	✅ 7-12 V DC Battery (LiPo 2S battery)
	•	✅ UBEC/Buck converter to step down voltage to 5V
	•	✅ Arduino Uno
	•	✅ Double-sided tape
	•	✅ Jumper wires
